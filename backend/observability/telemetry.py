LLM token usage and cost telemetry.

Wraps structured-output LLM calls to capture prompt/completion token counts
and an approximate USD cost, without changing the calling agent functions'
signatures or return types (existing callers and test mocks are unaffected).
Usage from calls made inside a `collect_usage()` block is accumulated and

    requests through a small, separately-pooled, contended set of workers
    on the hosted endpoint, unrelated to schema size/content or anything
    this application controls.

    nvext.guided_json returns HTTP 200 while silently ignoring the schema

    Invokes `llm` for structured `schema` output with bounded request timeout,
    token telemetry recording, structured error classification, and bounded safe provider fallback.

    Maximum provider attempts: 3 (Primary -> Fallback -> Structured Error), with
    one bounded exception: if the Fallback provider itself fails specifically
    with a rate-limit/quota error AND a third, distinct, credentialed provider
    is configured, exactly one further attempt is made against that provider
    before failing closed - a rate-limited provider is known-exhausted, so
    re-raising immediately would give up on a real, already-available
    alternative. No provider is ever attempted more than once, and no
    provider is ever selected without a valid, present API key.
    Fallback is ONLY allowed for explicitly classified transient failures and timeouts.
    Authentication errors, invalid requests, and policy/schema failures NEVER trigger fallback.
